# This is the simple listing of requirements for schemaorg python to 
# read and for the user to provide to create a complete entry for 
# a container recipe as a Dataset. No, a container is not a Dataset,
# but this is important to show how we can index these with Google Search!
# To properly do this, the search should be able to index ImageDefinition.

## A Dataset

# Attributes not listed are accepted, but not required or recommended. If an

# be ignored.

# Without a key:pair implies the key is equal to the value, e.g., "license"
# in schema.org gets mapped to "license" for the Google dataset
