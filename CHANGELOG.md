# Changelog

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them.
Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults

versions here coincide with releases on pypi.
