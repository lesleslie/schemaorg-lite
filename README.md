# schemaorg-lite

This module is a stripped down version of
schemaorg: [https://www.github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg](https://www.github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg).
It will gather search engine metadata, from schema.org, and produce json-ld that can be embedded in a web
page or similar, intended to power search.

We provide schema.org 23.0 and later.

## What is this not?

This library is not intended to provide advanced functions around querying the ontology,
but rather accessing the definitions and tagging content with them.
