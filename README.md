# schemaorg Python

This module will serve functions for researchers and users to apply schema.org
definitions to their datasets, software, and other worldly things. For 
development functions with Python along with the web interface that
serves the published specifications, please see [https://www.github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg](https://www.github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg).

## What is this not?

This library is not intended to provide advanced functions around querying the ontology,
but rather accessing the definitions and tagging content with them.
